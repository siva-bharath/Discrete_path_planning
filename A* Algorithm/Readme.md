## Problem Definition 
The purpose of this task is to find the shortest path for a robot moving inside a 5x6 map from start to goal position using different path planning algorithms. 
The robot can only move in four directions: up, left, down, and right. 
At first, the problem is modeled using classes in C++ and later solve it with the BFS and A* algorithms.
